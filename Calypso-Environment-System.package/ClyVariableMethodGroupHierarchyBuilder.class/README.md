I am a root of hierarchy of builders which create hierarchical view on instance or class variables.
I arrange variables in two level subgroups: 
	- subgroup for variables declaring by class1
		- subgroup for var1
		- subgroup for var2
	- subgroup for variables declaring by class2
		- subgroup for var3
		- subgroup for var4
	- ...
I skip superclasses which do not provide any variables
