I am a query of unclassified classes.

I a bit complex class query which returns classes without any tag.
The complexity is related to the logic that I will return nothing from the package which has no tags at all.

You can see class group #extensions which is based on me. 
It appears only when tagged and untagged classes exist together in the package
