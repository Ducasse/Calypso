I am a command to switch the current scope of the query in the query browser.

Currently I support only context menu and toolbar activation where I retrieve available navigation scopes from the browser to allow user select one of them.

Internal Representation and Key Implementation Points.

    Instance Variables
	queryScope:		<ClyScope>
